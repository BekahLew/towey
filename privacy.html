        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>We do our best to transfer and save all of your memories to archive grade media. However, every so often someone wants service for free, so we have to say all sales are final and there are no refunds. Know that we have been in business 29 years now and we have an amazing following. Most of our business is through referral. Your precious memories are all handled personally by myself and will receive the best care.</p>
        <p>Thank you,
            <br/>Dan Towey</p>
